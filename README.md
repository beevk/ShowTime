# Show-Time

Show-time is an app to track your favorite series. You can check information like total episodes, aired date, cast etc. about your favourite series here.
This is just some random app that I worked on while I was bored.
You can check live demo [here.](http://frozen-springs-87821.herokuapp.com)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
